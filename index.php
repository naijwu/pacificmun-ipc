                    <p>
                        The International Press Corps is a highly-acclaimed and reputable international news publishing organization that provides expository, peer-reviewed, and engaging accounts of controversial current events taking place all over the world.
                        <br><br>
                        Reporters will be faced with a multitude of news from a wide array of committees, respectively ranging from beginner to crisis level topics. Delegates will be assigned certain tasks throughout the conference, but will be given substantial freedom in regards to how they choose execute their assignments, whether it be through an interview, a written article, or a live newsclip. With this freedom, IPC provides reporters with a realistic experience into the realm of fast-paced and investigative journalism. Featured pieces will be published onto a PacificMUN news forum that will be accessible to all delegates during the weekend iteration.
                        <br><br>
                        The International Press Corps is a unique committee that challenges the typical Model UN experience. Both beginner and advanced delegates are welcome, although those with a particular interest or passion in journalism and creative writing may find this simulation to be especially rewarding.
